            <li><b>or many of us, the past year has disrupted deeply ingrained habits. Some people report exercising less, others are drinking more. As we look forward</b></li>
            <li><b>Habits are like shortcuts — they’re things we can do quickly and without thinking because we’ve done them so often they’ve become automatic, says behavioral scientist Katy Milkman of the University of Pennsylvania.</b></li>
            <li><b>In an ideal world, good habits such as exercising, healthy</b></li>
            <li><b>We’ve long been told by society that the new year is the perfect time to make a fresh start. Milkman agrees, but she points out that the year is filled with additional opportunities — such as birthdays, holidays and even ordinary Mondays. Her research has shown that people are more likely to visit the gym around fresh-start dates like these. </b></li>
            <li><b>Immediate rewards can help reinforce a new habit. A Harry Potter fan, for example, might listen to the audiobooks while exercising as an in-the-moment reward for working out.</b></li>
            <li><b>Preparation can make it easier to follow through with healthy habits. Don’t want to sleep in your running shoes? Consider putting them on before your morning coffee so you are ready to go.</b></li>
            <li><b>To break a bad habit, substituting a healthier alternative is often easier than quitting cold turkey.</b></li>
