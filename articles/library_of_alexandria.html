    <h3>Growth of the library</h3>
    <p>The association of the library with the Mouseion, whose scholars required a reliable resource, helped the library to develop into a proper research centre. Its location close to the harbour and within the royal palace’s grounds placed it under the direct supervision of the kings. Those circumstances aided the rapid growth of the library’s collection. Within half a century of its foundation circa 295 BCE, the collections of the Royal Library had exceeded the space allotted to contain the accumulated books. It was found necessary to establish an offshoot that could house the surplus volumes. To that end, Ptolemy III (246–221 BCE) incorporated the branch library into the newly built Serapeum, which was situated at a distance from the royal quarter in the Egyptian district south of the city. Estimates of the total number of books in the library vary. The earliest surviving figure, from the 3rd century BCE, is reported as “more than 200,000 books,” whereas the medieval text of John Tzetzes mentions “42,000 books in the outer library; in the inner (Royal) Library 400,000 mixed books, plus 90,000 unmixed books.” A still higher estimate of 700,000 was reported between the 2nd and 4th centuries CE.
